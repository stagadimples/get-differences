## Tracking Information

### Approach
* Create a special folder for all data files
* Data files must be labeled according to month it refers to. This helps with sorting files in the folder.
* Create a master tracking worksheet that sits outside of the data folder. This is where the overall summary will be monitored.
	* Create the following 3 tabs in the summary sheet
		* Cancelled-Customers
		* New-Customers
* Create a VBA module in the tracking-worksheet, and update the 2 tabs with the appropriate sets of data.
